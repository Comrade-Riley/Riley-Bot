# Riley-Bot-WIP
Is a multipurpose bot I'm making with python3 and discord.py

# Events
- Join/Leave events
- OnMessage event (for levels)

# Basic Commands
r.help sends you the help page 

- r.rank (check your rank on your discord server)

- r.ranks (check the top 5 ranks on your discord server)

- r.howsus <mention> (joke command to see "how sus" a user is in your discord server)
  
- r.wiki <topic> (sends you apart of a wiki article)
  
- r.search <query> (sends you the google results of a query)
  
- r.video <query> (sends you the youtube result of a query)
  
- r.img <query> (sends you the google image result of a query)
  
 this is just the basic commands, not all of them. Do "r.help" for more commands
